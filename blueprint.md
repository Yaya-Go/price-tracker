## Overview

This document outlines the architecture and features of the Price Tracker application. The app allows users to track the prices of items over time, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.

## Features

*   **User Authentication:** Users can create an account and log in using their email and password.
*   **Item Tracking:** Users can add, edit, and delete items they want to track.
*   **Price Logging:** For each item, users can log prices at different locations.
*   **Categorization:** Items can be organized into categories.
*   **Location Management:** Users can manage a list of locations where they purchase items.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

*   `lib/`: Contains the main application code.
    *   `main.dart`: The entry point of the application.
    *   `src/`: Contains the core application logic.
        *   `models/`: Data models for the application.
        *   `providers/`: State management providers.
        *   `services/`: Services for interacting with external APIs (e.g., Firebase).
        *   `ui/`: UI components and screens.

## Plan

1.  **Review and fix all errors in the project.**
2.  **Create a `blueprint.md` file to document the project.**
3.  **Answer the user's request.**
